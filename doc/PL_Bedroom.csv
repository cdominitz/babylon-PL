Painted products should be suspect. You can tell the difference between painted vs powder coating by using a penny to scrape the surface in an area not generally seen. Paint will scratch off easily vs powder coated surfaces which are much harder to remove. Mattresses come in many formats from the common coil and cloth to the various foams, and combinations. The key is to know the composition, is the foam petrochemical or natural, has there been any treatments to the fabrics and are they organic. Check the labels on the products and look for both the GOTS (Global Organic Trade Standard) certification, as one example of and ideal product. Remember there are many trade certifications that are meaningless, so look for more information on PureLiving.com.
