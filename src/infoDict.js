    "description": "For your headboard and footboard, the safest way to go is powder coated metal or real wood sealed with safe stains and coatings. Painted products should be suspect. You can tell the difference between painted vs powder coating by using a penny to scrape the surface in an area not generally seen. Paint will scratch off easily vs powder coated surfaces which are much harder to remove. Mattresses come in many formats from the common coil and cloth to the various foams, and combinations. The key is to know the composition, is the foam petrochemical or natural, has there been any treatments to the fabrics and are they organic. Check the labels on the products and look for both the GOTS (Global Organic Trade Standard) certification, as one example of and ideal product. Remember there are many trade certifications that are meaningless, so look for more information on PureLiving.com. Boxes Springs and Foundations can be made in a number of ways, typically they consist of a wood frame, coils and are covered with fabric. They are often treated for stain and mold resistance and this poses a health problem. Check the labels and ask questions. When it comes to fabric-based products always check the label for the composition and any treatments of the items. Avoid the non-organics as remember the majority of pesticides are used in growing cotton and you don’t want to be sleeping, sweating and getting these chemicals in your body. Some items such as 100% bamboo may be a better option, or use GOTS (Global Organic Trade Standard) certified cotton products. For more details see PureLiving.com.",
